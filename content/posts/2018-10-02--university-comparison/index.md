This issue gets me into trouble a lot !! I have degrees from Canada, America, and England. I have experience lots of differences and similarities. There are UK universities better than US universities and vice versa when it comes to rankings. It also depends on you, what you like !! Do you like constant exams and assignments then US university is for you, do you like to submit everything and do exams by the end of the academic year then go UK !

In my opinion, which is only mine not anyone else and I don’t want to generalize here, so let’s just confirm it’s only my opinion that is based on my own experience, I think US universities education is much better than UK because I’m that type of person who would rather to be tested multiple times for every class so information can get stuck in my head and learn from my mistakes. In England you only get 1 exam for that class, only one shot and it could worth 60% sometimes 80%, how could I learn my mistakes from one exam plus one exam is so frustrating !! how if I was tired that day ?? or if I was very nervous ?? I had a class that worth 80% and the project worth 20% .. I was sweating like an ocean in the exam room !!! I passed but barely !! and it was hard exam, but the question here did I learn from that exam ? the answer is NO !! ? The reason for the exam is to test your abilities and at the same time you learn your mistakes so next exam if this information that you messed up in your previous exams showed up again in mid-terms or final, or even project you would be ready for it, so this only happens in American and Canadian systems not in the UK. Sorry British friends !

I went to Newcastle University in North-East of England to do a master’s degree which is a great university, but I think I learned a lot when I went to Penn State, USC, and UBC.

Keep in mind top US universities many of them have more facilities than any UK university. US universities tend to be huge and and more fun. I had fun in England but it’s nothing like the ones I had in America. Canada is boring as shit .. I didn’t like it that much even though the people are super friendly. If you like education and fun, my advice go Florida, California, or Arizona. They have top universities with extra fun ;)
