Actually, John’s motivations are about the most realistic thing in that whole film, and it’s the detail paid to his character which made the movie a hit.

This:

Isn’t John Wick. He’s not a guy you see on the bus on the way to work. This old trope, the “old killer out for revenge” trope has been done a thousand times before and never played as well, because normal people don’t do things like kill people over a dog, or even over a wife.

John Wick solves this problem by making it clear that this man:

Isn’t normal.

Simply put, John is insane. And I’m not using “insane” as a synonym for “badass.” I mean he literally ought to be in an institution somewhere.

And the movie hammers that point home again and again and again, until it is actually the point of the movie.

Seriously, just watch and see how everyone else reacts when you so much as mention his name.

We’re introduced to an entire society of mob bosses and professional assassins and John makes them all nervous because not only is he the best, he’s also insane.

A normal assassin cuts a deal when you tie them to a chair and point a gun at their head. John tells you he’s going to kill you and everyone you love, and keeps trying until he dies or you do.

A normal assassin will beat up a guy that talks shit about him at a bar. John will stab them to death with a pencil, and the two other guys who try to hold him back.

A normal assassin might kill Iosef for killing his dog. John Wick will kill every person in the city even related to Viggo’s organization.

That’s why, at the most pivotal moment of the story, they have this gem of dialogue:

People keep asking if I'm back and I haven't really had an answer...But now, yeah, I'm thinkin' I'm back!

Actually, Keanu’s face says it all:

It’s never been about the dog.

It’s about who’s going to be the first one on John’s shit-list now that his wife isn’t around anymore to keep him human.

It’s not the new John, filled with rage over a “fucking dog” that they’re worried about.

It’s the old John, the one they barely managed to survive last time, and who everyone had waiting with held breath to see what he would do now that his wife is gone…
