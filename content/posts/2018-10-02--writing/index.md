Writing in the English language goes conjointly with reading. Reading is the perfect norm that extensively aids in building a refined vocabulary, this subsequently leads to improved and fluent writing. Thus if your motive is to enhance your writing calibre, I primarily request you to make reading your best pal.

The quote “reading is like breathing in and writing is like breathing out” aptly provide the summation relevant to these two correlated activities and their immense significance. You do not have to immerse yourself in reading gigantic books, start with anything that suits your vibe. Books offer you major diversity, henceforth find the one that you like and begin the learning process.

Apart from reading, I am listing a few vital pointers that will aid your writing performance:

* begin with penning down basic scenarios. Anything you feel is worthy of writing about.
* Actively work towards improving your grammar. punctuation greatly helps in writing fluently and builds reader’s clarity.
* Join online forums or writing clubs.
* Be more expressive. communicate freely, criticism is the perfect key to self-improvement.
* Observe writing style of good authors. That gives you an immense idea of the dos and dons
* Do not make your writing flamboyant to attract appreciation. At times simplicity just does the trick
lastly be your own critic and mentor

Once you incorporate these points to your daily life,learning writing will not be a fry-cry anymore.just remember every learning journey takes time and writing is no different.pay no heed to the mistakes you make.The more errors you make,the better shall you learn.

Happy writing :)
