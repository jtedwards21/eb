The USA and Britain have had a very disproportionately large share of military, cultural, political, economic, and linguistic influence on the world over the last 150 years or so, during which literacy rates have risen worldwide and higher education and access to industrial and information technology have become necessary for economic success everywhere.

Do Britain and the USA—and to a lesser extent other Anglophone countries—dominate university rankings because they are so powerful?

Or have Britain and the USA become powerful because they have top-notch universities which educate their elites (as well as elite foreigners, nowadays)?

I think there is probably a bit of a positive feedback loop in here, including a very important role for the English language. English has become an indispensable language for educated people worldwide:

* The globe-spanning British Empire helped to pave the way
* US dominance during the Cold War cemented it.
* The Internet, an offshoot of the US military's ARPANET project, and the World Wide Web, whose founding is credited to British academic Tim Berners-Lee, have further magnified the role of English.

Because English is so valuable for exchanging ideas and information nowadays, universities in English-speaking countries have a tremendous advantage. The best students and researchers almost anywhere in the world are quite likely to already know English, but may not know or want to learn French or Spanish or Chinese, for instance. So universities in English-speaking countries attract people from all over the world, and network effects cause their quality and prestige to continue to rise.

I suspect that the relative strength of the USA, compared to Britain and Canada, is mostly due to population size; all three countries are democratic and seem to be appealing to immigrants. I wouldn't be surprised if major universities in India rise to the top over the next few decades, as India becomes increasingly wealthy and educated.
